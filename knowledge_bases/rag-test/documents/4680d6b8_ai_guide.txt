Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Guide

Chapter 1: What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
These networks can learn hierarchical representations of data automatically.
Common architectures include CNNs for image processing and RNNs for sequential data.

Chapter 2: Transformer Architecture
The Transformer architecture was introduced in the paper Attention Is All You Need in 2017.
It relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence.
Key components include multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward networks.
BERT, GPT, and T5 are all based on the Transformer architecture.

Chapter 3: Vector Databases
Vector databases store high-dimensional embeddings for similarity search.
ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Weaviate are popular choices.
They enable semantic search by finding vectors closest to a query embedding.
