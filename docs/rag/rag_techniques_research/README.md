# RAG Techniques Research

This folder is dedicated to focused research on the `RAG_Techniques` project:
- Source repo: `https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques`
- Local clone: `learn_proj/RAG_Techniques`

Suggested structure:
- `notes/`: reading notes by topic
- `experiments/`: local experiment logs and results
- `summaries/`: concise findings and action items

Current starter documents:
- `notes/00_repo_landscape.md`
- `notes/01_learning_roadmap_for_lex_mint.md`
- `notes/02_technique_inventory.md`
- `experiments/phase1_experiment_plan.md`
- `summaries/initial_takeaways.md`

Current execution focus (as of 2026-02-19):
- Active RAG foundation is done in mainline (planner + structured source context + tool-based search/read).
- This research track now prioritizes retrieval quality experiments (context enrichment/compression, adaptive routing, evaluation gates).
